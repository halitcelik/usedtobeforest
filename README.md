This website aims to list all the hotels that used to be forest but burned.

# TODO:
BACKEND
- Hotel Model (name, booking id, tripadvisor id, construction year ...)
- Forest Model (name, type of tree, estimated number of trees, estimated number of species, hectares, fire year)
- Image Model (hotel, file)
- Address
- Forms (for everyone to be able to upload hotels/touristic establishment that were constructed after a forest fire - Django form widget)
- Deployment (Fabfile?)
- Find a Hotel API to get complementary information about the hotel?
- 

FRONTEND
- Quickly create a github page associated with the account, so that in the meantime, people can see a page saying what all that is about.
- Discuss a CSS library (Tailwind?)
